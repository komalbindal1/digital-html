        Content marketing uses storytelling and information sharing to increase brand awareness. Ultimately, the goal is to have readers take action toward becoming a customer, such as requesting more information, signing up for an email list or making a purchase. “Content” can refer to blog posts, resources like white papers and e-books, digital videos, podcasts and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, it should first and foremost provide value to the consumer — not just advertise the brand or try to make a sale. Content marketing is about building a sustainable, trusting relationship with your customers that can potentially lead to many sales over time, not just a single transaction.
    </p>
<p>
    Content marketing works in symbiosis with other types of digital marketing: It is a way to incorporate search engine optimization (SEO) into fresh website content, and the content created can be shared as social media posts and in email marketing publications. Looking at the analytics for your content marketing can tell you a lot about your customers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are they looking for when they land on your site?
    </li>
    <li>
        What kinds of content make them stay on the site longer and keep looking around?
    </li>
    <li>
        What kinds make them lose interest and navigate away?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Unlike a method such as PPC, content marketing is a long-term strategy. Over time, marketers build up a library of content (text, video, podcasts, etc.) that will continue to bring users to the site via search engines, according to Adobe Experience Cloud, an organization that specializes in digital experience tools. This content library also helps promote knowledge of your brand and increases your profile as a resource for information.
</p>
<p>
    And, if users are visiting your site for information, ideally they will remember you as an authority when it’s time to make a purchase.
</p>
<p>
    Content marketing is a great avenue for people who enjoy writing and/or video and audio production. But as with digital marketing in general, it also calls for strong strategic and analytic skills.
</p>
<p>

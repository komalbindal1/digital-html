    The goal of SEO is to get a business to rank higher in Google search results, ultimately increasing search engine traffic to the business’s website.
</p>
<p>
    To accomplish this, SEO marketers research words and phrases consumers are using to search for information online and use those terms in their own content. According to leading SEO software company Moz's "Beginners Guide to SEO," SEO encompasses many elements, from the words on your web pages to the way other sites link to you on the web to how your website is structured. An SEO specialist earns a median of $73,690, according to Salary.com.

    So, what are some things that can improve a site’s SEO? It’s important to understand that one of the things that makes SEO challenging is that the answer to this question always depends on search engines and their most current algorithm
</p>
<p>
    Keeping that in mind, here are a few of the most important things for SEO strategists and marketers, in general, to understand about how SEO works today, according to Moz:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Content indexing – It is important to allow search engines to clearly “read” what your site content is, by doing things like adding alt text for images and text transcripts for video and audio content.

<li>Good link structure – It is important that search engines can “crawl” your site structure to easily find all the content on your site. There are many things that an SEO specialist can do to properly format links, URLs and sitemaps to make them most accessible to site crawlers.
</li>
<li>Keywords and keyword targeting – Properly deploying your keywords (i.e. the search terms you want your site to be found for) in your content and headers is one of the fundamental building blocks of SEO. It is no longer good practice to “stuff” your content with as many keywords and keyword variations as possible. Writing high-quality content that uses keywords in the headers and a few times in the crawl-able page content is now considered better practice and will make pages rank better in search results.

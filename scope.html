    <p>
        More than half of consumers discover companies through social media news feeds. Companies can reach almost 1 million customers via Instagram alone, and more than 9 million businesses use Facebook to connect with consumers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Companies leverage social media platforms for both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) digital marketing campaigns.
    </p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    B2B: To generate leads, B2B marketers are active on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter. They also often rely on PPC campaigns to reach their target audiences without spending too much money.
  </li>
  <li>
    B2C: B2C marketers focus on improving brand awareness and attracting customers to their websites and products using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.
  </li>
    </ul>

        While posting ads and content on Facebook and other popular platforms continue to be an effective way to reach your target market, the scope of digital marketing encompasses much more than just social media. In addition to social media, savvy businesses also employ the following methods to reach new audiences while building (and maintaining) their brand awareness:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Paid search: Marketers pay Google and other search engine companies a fee whenever someone types in your keyword, and their ad is shown at the top of the search results (“PPC” model).  
        </li>
        <li>
            Organic (or natural) search: This method takes more finesse than PPC since marketers are using keyword analysis and other search engine optimization (SEO) methods to naturally push their content to the top of the list of natural search results on Google and other search engines.
        </li>
        <li>
            Email marketing campaigns: Believe it or not, email marketing campaigns (if done properly) are still very effective at reaching your target market, and they’re also very accessible for small businesses.
        </li>
        <li>
            Content marketing: Publishing helpful articles, guides, tutorials, and other online content (in addition to webinars and podcasts) that engages your target audience is the essence of content marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Webinars: This is a great way to provide something of value to target consumers while also promoting your brand and products.
        </li>
        <li>
            Podcasts: Compelling audio content is another way to reach your audience and can be used in conjunction with other media for broader marketing campaigns.
        </li>
    </ul>

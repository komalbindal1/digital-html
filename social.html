        This includes everything a business does via social media channels. Just about everyone is familiar with social media, but marketers must approach social with an integrated and strategic approach. Social media marketing goes far beyond simply creating posts for social channels and responding to comments

        To be effective, efforts must be coordinated and consistent rather than an afterthought. To help keep posts consistent, there are many online tools available to automate and schedule social media posts, although marketers only should use automation as a tool, not a “set it and forget it” solution. Users will figure it out quickly if there is no real person behind the posts.

        Social media marketers should not be in a silo separate from other marketing functions. Social marketers need to work with the company’s wider marketing team to coordinate their message across all platforms, online and off, so that every part of the brand is telling the same story.

        A crucial part of social media marketing is analytics. Social media marketers must also be savvy at analyzing the performance of their posts and creating strategies based on that data. It’s important to measure how well your current social media posts are performing before continuing to implement your new strategy.

    Statista reports that 86% of industry professionals stated that an increase in exposure to their company was the leading benefit of social media marketing in 2023. Behind that, 76% of companies claimed an increase in traffic to their website was the largest advantage.

    There are also several free options to spread your message that go beyond Instagram and Twitter. Some other options include Google My Business, eBay and Facebook Messenger and Marketplace.

    In other words, social media marketing is a lot more complicated than managing your personal Facebook or Twitter profile. It requires a blend of creative thinking and objective, data-driven strategy and may be a great fit for professionals who enjoy blending these two disciplines. A social media analyst with a bachelor's degree, such as a social media marketing degree, can earn about $72,222, according to Salary.com.
